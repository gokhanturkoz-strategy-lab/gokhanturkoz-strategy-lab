# Gökhan Türköz, PhD 👋

Welcome to my Research & Strategy Lab. I am a **Quantitative Strategy Scholar**, with expertise in computational methods, firm performance, strategic investments, financial valuation and strategic decision-making.



## 🔬 Research Focus
My studies focus on bridging the gap between advanced optimization algorithms and high-level strategic management. I leverage:
- **Causal Inference:** Identifying the true impact of strategic decisions on performance using esp. R & Python.
- **Network Science:** Analyzing strategic alliances and interlocking directorates.
- **Computational Management:** Data-driven organizational design, risk analyses and investment strategies.
- **Spatial Optimization:** Resource allocation and risk analyses using several emprical and heuristic algorithms.
